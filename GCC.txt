GRID COMPUTING PROJECTS IN INDIA AND WORLD

Introduction

Grid computing is a distributed computing model where multiple computers work together to solve complex problems. It allows resources to be shared across different geographical locations, enabling researchers and organizations to process large-scale computations efficiently. Many countries have developed grid computing projects to advance scientific research, engineering, and data processing. In this assignment, we discuss one major grid computing project from India and one from the world, highlighting their objectives, significance, and impact.
