Download ns-2.35 from the website. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam...

Since ns2.35 is too old (2011) and hence it will work on the gcc and g++ version of 4.8. So we need to change the default gcc to gcc-4.8 and g++ to g++-4.8

Here are the files that need to be modified.

Make the changes in the following files
@CC@ to be replaced with gcc-4.8
@CPP@ to be replaced with g++-4.8

ns-allinone-2.35/Makefile.in
/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/otcl-1.14/Makefile.in
nam-1.15/Makefile.in
xgraph-12.2/Makefile.in

all changes were made.

In all the above places, change @CC@ to gcc-4.8 
and @CPP@ @CXX@ to g++-4.8

Open the file 
ns-2.35/linkstate/ls.h
in line number 137, change the line erase to this (->) erase

Run the installation now
Open a terminal

$ cd ns-allinone-2.35/

$ ./install

Once the installation is over, Set the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH infomration in the file located at 
open another terminal and issue the following command.
$ gedit /home/pradeepkumar/.bashrc

export PATH=$PATH:/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/bin:/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/tcl8.5.10/unix:/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/tk8.5.10/unix
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/otcl-1.14:/home/pradeepkumar/ns-allinone-2.35/lib

The field separator is a colon : here and there should not any blank space between the paths....

$ source .bashrc

$ns
% indicates it install successfully.

$nam 
a window gets popped up
It works well.
